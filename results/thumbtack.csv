My approach to design starts with a functional analysis of the client’s needs and an examination of thesite whether a plot of land or an existing space to be renovated. I believe that when working with the client, we make choices that foster the client’s own sensibilities to reflect their lifestyle. Together we embark on a design journey towards a fulfilling result, both beautiful and practical.I earned a Master of Architecture Degree from the University of Pennsylvania where I was a recipient of The E. Lewis Dales Travelling Fellowship. I also hold a Bachelor’s Degree in the Design of the Environment and the History of Art from Penn. During the course of my study I was influenced by a tradition of architecture that nurtures beauty from function.As the lead architectural designer at Drake Design Associates, NYC, from 2002 to 2015, the variety of my work included residential projects and civic commissions. The creative evolution and vast practical experience I gained has been invaluable, particularly the influence of color and materials on built form. From the understated formality of refurbishing City Hall, to the theatricality and glamour of residential projects I am expert in visual tempo and effect.I have effectively managed projects with strict construction schedules and have successfully worked with many of Manhattan’s most stringent co-op boards.

The top decorators and designers, Kevin McNamara, Clair Fraser, Mark Hampton, Mario Buatta, Tom Britt, Tony Ingrao. Very fine painting(all with oil paint and brushes), specialty glazing and wallpaper hanging. I left that business to train under a antique restorer for 5 years where I had the chance to learn my trade (there is soo much to learn and always an exceptions to every rule) and most recently on my own for the past 7 years. At Zsikla Restoration, I pride myself on delivering the very best finished product that more than meets your satisfaction and earns the reputation of repeat business.When I stand in front of a new project I feel an inner competition with the last person that worked on it and I always want my work to exceed the last tradesman that touched that particular piece. After I finish the refinishing or restoration work, the end result of how it looks and having you, the client, be excited to receive the new and improved piece, reminds me each time of why I do what I do. I was trained by an old world craftsman where I learned the importance of fine workmanship and I am very fortunate to work in a field that I enjoy every day.Please note that I pay for the chance to bid on your project, so in order for me to provide an accurate proposal it greatly helps if you send a photo of the project. I am also free to answer any questions you may have should you wish to work on the piece yourself first, so feel free to contact me.Thank you for taking the time to review my profile and I look forward to hearing from you.Simply the satisfaction of doing my work to the best of my abilities is the key to enjoying the work I do.",https://www.facebook.com/Zsikla-Restoration-440779846036883/,

My goal is to achieve 100 percent satisfaction every time. I provide efficient and affordable solutions to most home and business owners work requests. No matter what the request may be, I am happy to discuss the options with every new customer before talking about quotes, or dates to complete the work. I welcome questions and enjoy being able to help anyone contacting me after receiving a quote understand the entire process from point of receiving a quote to point of completing the work and every moment in between. I provide accurate and easy to understand communication with every customer, regardless of if they've hired me yet or not. I want to make sure that each and every new and potential customer feels confident and comfortable choosing me to provide them with the services they need. This is almost as important to me as possessing the actual skills to complete the job - No home or business owner should be kept in the dark about what is going on at their place weather it be a one day property clean up or a week long demolition project. You will see me on every job. If I send you a quote, I will be there to explain it. If you request an estimate in person... I will be the one to show up to estimate the job in person, and I will be the one completing the work for you. I value the complete satisfaction of a customer over payment, every time. If you're not happy with the finished results, I don't want to get paid until you ARE happy with them... it's that simple.I am insured in the state of NJ to complete residential work and can provide a copy of my insurance certificate upon request.Every project is a completely different challenge, and knowing that it's up to me to pull off exactly what a customer wants, without fail... is something that I welcome, and enjoy.","https://facebook.com/david.carota.llc,https://instagram.com/david_carota_llc",

My goal is to achieve 100 percent satisfaction every time. I provide efficient and affordable solutions to most home and business owners work requests. No matter what the request may be, I am happy to discuss the options with every new customer before talking about quotes, or dates to complete the work. I welcome questions and enjoy being able to help anyone contacting me after receiving a quote understand the entire process from point of receiving a quote to point of completing the work and every moment in between. I provide accurate and easy to understand communication with every customer, regardless of if they've hired me yet or not. I want to make sure that each and every new and potential customer feels confident and comfortable choosing me to provide them with the services they need. This is almost as important to me as possessing the actual skills to complete the job - No home or business owner should be kept in the dark about what is going on at their place weather it be a one day property clean up or a week long demolition project. You will see me on every job. If I send you a quote, I will be there to explain it. If you request an estimate in person... I will be the one to show up to estimate the job in person, and I will be the one completing the work for you. I value the complete satisfaction of a customer over payment, every time. If you're not happy with the finished results, I don't want to get paid until you ARE happy with them... it's that simple.I am insured in the state of NJ to complete residential work and can provide a copy of my insurance certificate upon request.Every project is a completely different challenge, and knowing that it's up to me to pull off exactly what a customer wants, without fail... is something that I welcome, and enjoy.","https://facebook.com/david.carota.llc,https://instagram.com/david_carota_llc",

We our house cleaners we do not recaulk or spackle! We can only do so much because removing mold we are releasing mold spores in the air and can get in your lungs! We use AJAX it a powder base bleach that we use and if that does not work it will most likely need to be recaulked or constantly stay in a bleach detergent for a few days. You also may need to have a charcoal-carbonated based bowl to prevent the bathroom from staying wet. We enjoy and take pride of our growing business.

We will bring your floors back to life ! Ask us for your free assessment. You’ll be amazed at what we can do - with minimum dust and fuss. Call on us to be sure your new floor will be in the sure hands of a friendly and reliable firm. A truly professional team who will give you the best advice - and do an efficient job at a fair price. Over time, the old layers of paint and sealant (black bitumen, oil, varnish or lacquer) on a wooden floor wear away. Couple this with accumulated dirt and the floor begins to look sad and dirty. Sanding machines are fitted with special sanding paper of various grades of coarseness. They strip the old sealant back to smooth bare wood.Sanding works splendidly on all kinds of wooden floors: hardwood (oak, beech or walnut) or softwood (pine, yew or Douglas fir); strip floors; herringbone; parquet blocks; mosaic and even cork.There are three stages: a rough, medium and fine sand to strip, level, and smooth the boards to leave a high quality finish. Restoration includes repairing - or replacing - any damaged floorboards. Gaps may also be filled.The smooth wood may then be stained. A natural stain enhances the original grain of the timber. A coloured stain is useful for a fresh look - that can match the floor to the décor of your home or commercial premises.The final stage is to protect the new floor with a sealant. The result? A beautiful and hard-wearing finish to provide years of service. !!Makeing people smile after job been done we love to see they happy faces..",,$2

We will bring your floors back to life ! Ask us for your free assessment. You’ll be amazed at what we can do - with minimum dust and fuss. Call on us to be sure your new floor will be in the sure hands of a friendly and reliable firm. A truly professional team who will give you the best advice - and do an efficient job at a fair price. Over time, the old layers of paint and sealant (black bitumen, oil, varnish or lacquer) on a wooden floor wear away. Couple this with accumulated dirt and the floor begins to look sad and dirty. Sanding machines are fitted with special sanding paper of various grades of coarseness. They strip the old sealant back to smooth bare wood.Sanding works splendidly on all kinds of wooden floors: hardwood (oak, beech or walnut) or softwood (pine, yew or Douglas fir); strip floors; herringbone; parquet blocks; mosaic and even cork.There are three stages: a rough, medium and fine sand to strip, level, and smooth the boards to leave a high quality finish. Restoration includes repairing - or replacing - any damaged floorboards. Gaps may also be filled.The smooth wood may then be stained. A natural stain enhances the original grain of the timber. A coloured stain is useful for a fresh look - that can match the floor to the décor of your home or commercial premises.The final stage is to protect the new floor with a sealant. The result? A beautiful and hard-wearing finish to provide years of service. !!Makeing people smile after job been done we love to see they happy faces..",,

Home Improvement,Home Inspection,House Pro Home Inspection,./results/images/152053870920155482_HouseProHomeInspection.jpg,5.0,116,"Introduction: Unfortunately too many inspectors take an ""in and out"" approach to something so important. They "" Zip in and Zip out"" so fast it leaves the buyers head spinning and confused . Its a little deceiving , to even call that ""act"" an inspection, yet this is the kind of service many buyers are receiving. House Pro Home Inspections does not play those games. Not only do i perform thorough, detailed inspections but also explain and teach the buyer how their house works. So by the time the inspection is over, usually 2-3hrs, they usually no more about this house than the one they lived in the past 10yrs ! Within 24hrs you receive a personalized detailed narrative report with pictures clearly explaining and reinforcing everything they saw at the time of the inspection. I am always available to the buyer way after they have moved in for any questions they may have. If a fast and cheap inspector is what you are looking for, sorry i cant help you. If you want real value, savings and a peace of mind then call me, you will be saving money in the long run.Saving clients from getting into a property they will regret they purchased . I am on your side, just remember that. I don't work for the agent or the mortgage company, only for you . You hired me to determine if this house is right for you! I want to make sure you move into the property without the fear of something going wrong.My inspections are extremely thorough and I recommend you join me during the inspection process to explain my findings and show you how your potential home works.","https://www.facebook.com/HouseProHomeInspections/,https://twitter.com/HouseProInspect",$250

I want to know your concerns about the inspection process, the property being inspected and what you the client envision the future to be in that house.I do prefer that my client is able to inspect the property alongside with me so that I can point out any items that I feel you need to know about and to answer any questions which may arise.I do realize that many buyers don't have a great deal of knowledge about the structure and the components that when put together make up the a livable and comfortable home. I will also explain what all that means to you.Rest assured that no question that you may ask me is a silly question, for there was once a time when I myself had very little knowledge about real estate property and houses. At the end of it all, you should be able to move forward with confidence about the house you are planning on purchasing.When your hire me, know that you hired an independent professional inspector who's only duty to to provide you with the best possible unbiased inspection report possibleWith my over 25 + year of practical experience in maintaining and repairing real estate properties, I will be able to explain whether anything I find should be a greater or lesser of a concern.I am also able to focus a little deeper than most inspectors because I also use an infrared thermal imaging camera when a need appears, as an infrared camera may be able to detect a hidden moisture problem which the naked eye would not be able to see. I provide this extra service without an extra charge. I only schedule no more than 2 inspections a day so if need be I'll be able to spend as much time as I need to inspect the property right, the first time!I also offer InterNACHI's BUY BACK Program, that states that if I miss anything, InterNACHI will buy it back at full purchase price! For more information click the link at the bottom of page.I was once a home buyer that just did not know much about the systems and components that comprise together that make a house into a home. Each system and component has a specific job to perform, and I will explain what each one does. No question that you may have is a bad questionI will treat you ""my client"" the same whether I am inspecting a 500 sq ft. home or a 5,000 sq ft. home. I will take the time to talk and explain any concerns and answer any questions that you may have. I know that if you knew more about the complexities of a house and the systems within you wouldn't need me.My goal is to bring you understanding of the story that a house is telling me during my inspection and explaining my findings in a clear and complete report.",,

Staging starts at $2500 and up but can be custom priced for less if u need only a few rooms staged. Seeing the space in person is BEST to give an accurate price as each home is different! We can stage the whole house or just a few rooms and pricing can be custom to your budget within reason. We own all our own furniture and our price includes moving it all in and taking it all out. Items are kept for three months. Beyond three months there is a monthly rental fee of roughly $200. Clients call raving they have sold for ABOVE ASKING as a bidding war can occur in buyers competing for the home. People who do NOT stage their homes will probably have to lower their properties by 10-30,000K when staging is a fraction of that cost! We approach staging as custom designers because we ARE DESIGNERS that help sell properties on average in a much quicker amount of time then if it sat empty on the market.Our specialty is making a space very unique with extremely tasteful decor in combining original decor pieces to enhance what you already have or stage an entirely vacant space into spectacular results.You’re hiring a stager to create that EMOTIONAL IMPACT when buyers walk in the door to enhance sales. This is a very artistic process to create “WOW” results which requires far MORE SKILL than just placing lifeless furniture in a house as the competition so often does. If it doesn’t feel and look expensive don’t expect to get more money for your house! We are EXPERTS on how make it look like you spent far more than you did as we give 100% to each job.Tie in the Sky Design owner Monique is highly creative and quick in solving any visual problem.

Cricket’s flare with pop art and contemporary chic hit the sweet spot with the gen-Xer. A Soho building developer hired Cricket to stage 6 model apartments in their newly renovated rental apartment building. The challenge was showing how tiny living can be super cool. They loved way the small apartments scaled up with Crickets decor. Cricket turned a New York City designer's office back into a Upper East Side one bedroom contemporary dream. The apartment went into contract within 24 hours of Cricket finishing the job.  A Bronxville family needed new rooms to be designed by Cricket after a recent renovation.

She has over fifteen years of experience refining her intuitive skills and developing an in-depth understanding of both the built environment and the individual's physical and psychological relationship to their body and their environment.Yoga:I work with students to find a customized practice that offers longevity and insight. I’ve taught multiple styles of yoga over the past decade, and I draw from all of these traditions at times. However, most sessions I teach Katonah yoga combining taoist theory, hatha yoga, breathwork and meditation... a potent therapeutic blend. For clients outside of NYC, travel may be arranged for in person sessions and I also offer online sessions.Feng Shui:Feng Shui refers to the Chinese philosophical study of our relationship to our environment both man-made and natural. It examines qi patterns within environments, humans, and cosmological forces using complex theoretical systems that have been developed and refined by practitioners over thousands of years. We are all, consciously or not, influenced by the environments we spend time in. Through conscious relationship we can make connections and changes to our external environments that expand and shift our internal landscape.TarotI have been using tarot for years in Feng Shui sessions to gain more insight into clients needs. Recently I've gotten requests for tarot-only sessions and I'm excited to offer this service on thumbtack. My main teacher has been Lindsay Mack, and I work in her style.Intuitive CounselingAll of my services include intuitive counseling. My goal with every client is to align them with their highest truth and shed what doesn't serve them. Sometimes clients would like to simply talk things through and that led me to offer counseling only sessions.",https://www.instagram.com/nkylefreeman,

My goal is to achieve 100 percent satisfaction every time. I provide efficient and affordable solutions to most home and business owners work requests. No matter what the request may be, I am happy to discuss the options with every new customer before talking about quotes, or dates to complete the work. I welcome questions and enjoy being able to help anyone contacting me after receiving a quote understand the entire process from point of receiving a quote to point of completing the work and every moment in between. I provide accurate and easy to understand communication with every customer, regardless of if they've hired me yet or not. I want to make sure that each and every new and potential customer feels confident and comfortable choosing me to provide them with the services they need. This is almost as important to me as possessing the actual skills to complete the job - No home or business owner should be kept in the dark about what is going on at their place weather it be a one day property clean up or a week long demolition project. You will see me on every job. If I send you a quote, I will be there to explain it. If you request an estimate in person... I will be the one to show up to estimate the job in person, and I will be the one completing the work for you. I value the complete satisfaction of a customer over payment, every time. If you're not happy with the finished results, I don't want to get paid until you ARE happy with them... it's that simple.I am insured in the state of NJ to complete residential work and can provide a copy of my insurance certificate upon request.Every project is a completely different challenge, and knowing that it's up to me to pull off exactly what a customer wants, without fail... is something that I welcome, and enjoy.","https://facebook.com/david.carota.llc,https://instagram.com/david_carota_llc",

Personal,House Sitting,Fresh Living Cleaners,./results/images/219264413294461288_FreshLivingCleaners.jpg,4.4,93,"Introduction: WE DO NOT DO HOARDER APARTMENTS OR BODY CLEAN UP!! THEY REQUIRE A HAZ-MAT CREW!! ONLY MOVE IN-MOVE OUT OR REGULAR HOME CLEANINGS!!!! THANK YOU!!!Greetings!!! I hope you are having a lovely day!! We are a family and friend company with 5 plus years of cleaning experience. We don't work on a time base the job is done when your home is fresh and clean. We use eco-friendly products to keep your kids and pets safe as well! Only if requested! We have microfiber rags, multi purpose cleaner, glass cleaner, wood polish,stainless steel cleaner, hardwood floor and floor cleaner to keep your home so fresh and clean!!! We do not provide brooms, mops or buckets or toilet bowl brushes. It is really gross and you would need to supply that your self please!! In move in-move outs we do not CLEAN WALLS! We do not polish lights, We can only remove as much as we can DO! We can't get out most water stains as well as oil spots. The landlord must provide PAINTING!!! WE SUGGEST GETTING THE SUPER TO PAINT AND DO MODIFICATIONS BEFORE REQUESTING SO WE CAN CLEAN UP THE AFTERMATH! Paint chips on floor we encourage us not to do because thats the CONTRACTOR job and we don't want to ruin floors. Most apartments use very cheap caulk and the landlord must do it! We our house cleaners we do not recaulk or spackle! We can only do so much because removing mold we are releasing mold spores in the air and can get in your lungs! We use AJAX it a powder base bleach that we use and if that does not work it will most likely need to be recaulked or constantly stay in a bleach detergent for a few days. You also may need to have a charcoal-carbonated based bowl to prevent the bathroom from staying wet. We enjoy and take pride of our growing business. We love to see our clients with smiles on their faces. We have dealt with all types of backgrounds! From clients that constantly travel to work and can never maintain their home from becoming new parents and just need the extra help to keep your mind at ease. Just to know we are giving a client some weight lifted off their shoulders means a lot to us! Some clients need more special care than others if they are suffering from ADHD or OCD or issues from preventing them to maintain their home.

THEY REQUIRE A HAZ-MAT CREW!! ONLY MOVE IN-MOVE OUT OR REGULAR HOME CLEANINGS!!!! THANK YOU!!!Greetings!!! I hope you are having a lovely day!! We are a family and friend company with 5 plus years of cleaning experience. We don't work on a time base the job is done when your home is fresh and clean. We use eco-friendly products to keep your kids and pets safe as well! Only if requested! We have microfiber rags, multi purpose cleaner, glass cleaner, wood polish,stainless steel cleaner, hardwood floor and floor cleaner to keep your home so fresh and clean!!! We do not provide brooms, mops or buckets or toilet bowl brushes. It is really gross and you would need to supply that your self please!! In move in-move outs we do not CLEAN WALLS! We do not polish lights, We can only remove as much as we can DO! We can't get out most water stains as well as oil spots. The landlord must provide PAINTING!!! WE SUGGEST GETTING THE SUPER TO PAINT AND DO MODIFICATIONS BEFORE REQUESTING SO WE CAN CLEAN UP THE AFTERMATH! Paint chips on floor we encourage us not to do because thats the CONTRACTOR job and we don't want to ruin floors. Most apartments use very cheap caulk and the landlord must do it! We our house cleaners we do not recaulk or spackle! We can only do so much because removing mold we are releasing mold spores in the air and can get in your lungs! We use AJAX it a powder base bleach that we use and if that does not work it will most likely need to be recaulked or constantly stay in a bleach detergent for a few days. You also may need to have a charcoal-carbonated based bowl to prevent the bathroom from staying wet. We enjoy and take pride of our growing business. We love to see our clients with smiles on their faces. We have dealt with all types of backgrounds! From clients that constantly travel to work and can never maintain their home from becoming new parents and just need the extra help to keep your mind at ease. Just to know we are giving a client some weight lifted off their shoulders means a lot to us! Some clients need more special care than others if they are suffering from ADHD or OCD or issues from preventing them to maintain their home. Angelica is going for her Psychology part time and is very helpful in easing minds and giving tips to relax and focus to do tasks.

Her work has been published countess times in HC&G, NYC&G, Beach, Hamptons, Avenue and Quest.She's known: As a talented style maven who understands the clients needs.... easy to work with....provides amazing work quickly... she's just gets the job done! One big difference to Cricket’s service is that her decorating business is uniquely supported by her online consignment business. Cricket has over 20,000 sq ft of amazing home furnishings she personally curated. She curates from a list of “who’s who” of stylish homes in the New York area. She sells on Cricketscrush.com but mostly uses the inventory for her decorating, jushing and staging projects. Jushing is a term she coined for her take on refreshing a home. She comes to your home with a truck load of her treasures to re-style your home's rooms in a day.  Jushing is an amazing option for those who have great furnishings but need a style re-refresh. If you’d like to see Cricket in action, watch her web series The Jusher on cricketscrush.com.Past clients include:• Cricket jushed up a large family home on the grounds of Westchester Country Club. She mixed Cricket Crush's inventory with the family’s decor. They were amazed with the transformation which occurred almost overnight! • A recently single woman needed Cricket to design her 3 bedroom apartment in New York City. She cried with joy when she came home from work to see what Cricket had done to her apartment in just a matters of hours. • Grandparents gifted Cricket services for their grand daughter’s first apartment in New York City. Cricket’s flare with pop art and contemporary chic hit the sweet spot with the gen-Xer. A Soho building developer hired Cricket to stage 6 model apartments in their newly renovated rental apartment building. The challenge was showing how tiny living can be super cool. They loved way the small apartments scaled up with Crickets decor. Cricket turned a New York City designer's office back into a Upper East Side one bedroom contemporary dream. The apartment went into contract within 24 hours of Cricket finishing the job.  A Bronxville family needed new rooms to be designed by Cricket after a recent renovation. Cricket created a home office for the working mom that has become the owners favorite getaway space. Several builders in The Hamptons have used Cricket's staging services for newly completed estates in Southampton, Bridgehampton and Watermill.  The ""working mom home office"" is at the top of list of rooms builders want Cricket to create.Notable work:Designer at Hamptons Design Showhouse - 2017, 2016, 2015 - Cover NYC&G / HC&G - December 2016.Cover NYC&G - July 2014 Beach - Story - August 2016Media: Segment NYC&G Online web TV - 2018Segment NBC’s Open House TV with Sara Gore - 2018The Jusher & other Crickets Crush webisodes - 30 EpisodesEvine Home Shopping Network - Crickets Crush Diamonds - 4 hours - 2016I love when clients are brought to tears when they see my work. Since I can work very fast using my existing inventory, I don't get into ""delays"" associated with custom made decors. Thus, the relationship I have with my clients is always very very good.  Not only do I get jazzed about hitting the desired aesthetic, I love when the project is done quickly. The speed at which I can transform a home really astonishes all of my clients.

Whether helping the client to select the right services, or even how-to go about the move, we help keep the costs of moving as affordable and cost effective as possible. We wouldn't want to spend our life savings to move, so why should you? No one should have to dig into their kids' college funds or their retirement account to move.Dealing with clients and packing the trucks. We deal with a variety clients on a day to day basis. Oftentimes, they are clients who under no circumstances would be able to make the move happen on their own. That's where we come in. We treat each client like a friend or family. We make sure that at the end of the service, they are happy with every element of the move.As for packing, we often hear our clients say ""Wow, you guys are great! It's like that game....you know, the one with the shapes!"" All we can do is smile at that point. But they're right. Packing a truck efficiently is like a game of Tetris. And you need to do it right. Packing a truck incorrectly can lead to damage to the clients articles, which isn't good for either party. By packing efficiently, you not only save room, but you save time. Packing haphazardly only leads to having to repack, reorganize and possibly try to repair damages. Do it right the first time and you'll keep the client's, as well as your own, stress levels to a minimum.",,

If you are looking to rid yourself of bed bugs, roaches, mice, rats, ants, silverfish, then we are the company for you! Affordable's responsibility is to to provide you with the best and most affordable pest control service available.Our Bedbug service comes with a 3 mouth guarantee, IF WE SERVICE YOUR ENTIRE APT OR HOUSE. Unfortunately, we can no longer offer Airbnb Apartments guarantees because bed bugs travel very easily from room to room which is why we offer $85 for every other room to encourage you to service the entire Apt or house!

My goal is to achieve 100 percent satisfaction every time. I provide efficient and affordable solutions to most home and business owners work requests. No matter what the request may be, I am happy to discuss the options with every new customer before talking about quotes, or dates to complete the work. I welcome questions and enjoy being able to help anyone contacting me after receiving a quote understand the entire process from point of receiving a quote to point of completing the work and every moment in between. I provide accurate and easy to understand communication with every customer, regardless of if they've hired me yet or not. I want to make sure that each and every new and potential customer feels confident and comfortable choosing me to provide them with the services they need. This is almost as important to me as possessing the actual skills to complete the job - No home or business owner should be kept in the dark about what is going on at their place weather it be a one day property clean up or a week long demolition project. You will see me on every job. If I send you a quote, I will be there to explain it. If you request an estimate in person... I will be the one to show up to estimate the job in person, and I will be the one completing the work for you. I value the complete satisfaction of a customer over payment, every time. If you're not happy with the finished results, I don't want to get paid until you ARE happy with them... it's that simple.I am insured in the state of NJ to complete residential work and can provide a copy of my insurance certificate upon request.Every project is a completely different challenge, and knowing that it's up to me to pull off exactly what a customer wants, without fail... is something that I welcome, and enjoy.","https://facebook.com/david.carota.llc,https://instagram.com/david_carota_llc",
